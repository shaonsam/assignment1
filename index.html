            <h3>Healthy food is important for our health!</h3>
            <p>Good health is central to human happiness and well-being that contributes significantly to prosperity and
                wealth and even economic progress, as healthy populations are more productive, save more and live
                longer.
                For a healthy life cycle, you need a healthy and balanced diet, good hygiene habits, staying in a proper
                shelter and getting enough sleep.
                In addition, you will have to participate in physical activities, weight management, and stress
                management activities. </p>

                <p>
                    The amount of vegetables you need to eat depends on your age, sex, height, weight, and level of
                    physical activity. For women, the amount can also depend on whether you are pregnant or
                    breastfeeding. Find the right amount for you by getting your MyPlate Plan. For general
                    recommendations by age, see the table below.

                <p>
                    Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving
                    yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your
                    health, and boosting your mood.

                <p>
                    A healthy diet doesn't require a lot of money, newfangled appliances or subsisting on any kind of
                    scheme that sounds like a gimmick. Because it's true what they say about what seems too good to be
                    true: Eating well means listening to that little voice inside that knows what healthy foods
                    generally look like – fresh and recognizable in nature – and what they don't: prepackaged and
                    processed.
